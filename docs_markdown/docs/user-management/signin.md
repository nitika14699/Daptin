### Sign In

Sign In is an [action](actions/actions) on user entity. Sign in takes two inputs:

- Email
- Password

When the user initiates Sign in action, the following things happen:

- Check if guests can peek users table (Peek permission)
- Check if guests can peek the particular user (Peek Permission)
- Match if the provided password bcrypted matches the stored bcrypted password
- If true, issue a JWT token, which is used for future calls

The main outcome of the Sign In action is the jwt token, which is to be used in the ```Authorization``` header of following calls.
