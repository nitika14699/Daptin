# Sub site

You can host multiple sites using daptin. A sub site is exposing a cloud storage folder statically under a sub-domain, domain or a path. 


Expose folders on cloud storage services as websites using your daptin instance.

!!! example "New subsite"
    - Select a cloud storage
    - Choose a domain/sub-domain
    - Choose a sub-path

Restart is required to reflect changes.


## Creating a new sub-site


!!! example "Exposing a folder as a subsite"
    - Goto dashboard https://dashboard.domain.com/
    - Click "Sub sites"
    - Click the green "+" icon
    - Type in the **hostname** this should be exposed to
      - this can be a domain or a sub-domain
      - the domain should be pointing to the daptin instance
    - Choose a **name**
    - **Path**: select a sub directory name to expose this sub-site. Your sub-site will be accessible at domain.com/<path>
    - **Cloud store Id**: choose an existing [cloud store](/cloudstore/cloudstore).

    Restart to enable serving the site.

Daptin will sync the cloud store locally and start serving it under the domain/path.
